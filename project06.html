        <h3>Hello, my name is Lenka...</h3>
      <p>... and this is my first attempt at online portfolio.</p>
      <article><p>I tried coding for the first time in February 2022 and gathered the courage to jump into learning more about programming a year later. I would like to work as a tester as I feel it would give me a good start in the field. Also I think testing is quite compatible with my strengths and how I approach work in general. Maybe one day I will even move into automated testing or some full-time development role. Wish me luck :-)</p>

      <article><p>What I do with my free time? Besides doing various online courses, I also enjoy reading (both fiction and testing or programming related books), spending time in National Technical Library (studying or hunting relevant books), going to cinemas, having a good cup of coffee and talk with a friend, going for walks, trying to exercise a bit, visiting my mum and my friends (who had already provided me with few 'nieces and nephews' to play with). I also really enjoy US/UK stand-up comedy. Occasionally I even manage to appear in some museum, a gallery or a theatre. Also I sometimes spend unhealthy amount of time staring into the abyss of YouTube as every other millenial... </p></article>
